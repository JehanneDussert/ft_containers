### Welcome to my ft_containers repository 👋

⭐️ The objective of ft_containers is to implement the various container types of the C++ standard template library (coded in C++98).

## 📈 To be completed ⤵️
- Containers : Vector, Map, Stack
- iterator system
- iterators_traits, reverse_iterator, enable_if, is_integral, equal/lexicographical compare, std::pair, std::make_pair
- member functions, non-member functions, overloads
- one binary with my containers and one with the same testing with STL containers

## 🔎 Vector ⤵️

```
[std::vector is a sequence container that encapsulates dynamic size arrays](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector)
```

## 🔎 Map ⤵️

```
[std::map is a sorted associative container that contains key-value pairs with unique keys.](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map)
```

## 🔎 Stack ⤵️

```
[The std::stack class is a container adapter that gives the programmer the functionality of a stack - specifically, a LIFO (last-in, first-out) data structure.](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/stack)
```

## 💡 Usage
- This project will have its own main.cpp which tests everything
