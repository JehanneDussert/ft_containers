### Welcome to my ft_containers repository 👋

⭐️ The objective of ft_containers is to implement the various container types of the C++ standard template library (coded in C++98).

## ✅ Completed ⤵️
- Vector container & tester
- Stack container & tester
- enable_if, equal/lexicographical compare, reverse_iterator, iterators_traits
- std::pair, std::make_pair

## 📈 To be completed ⤵️
- Container : Map & tester
- one binary with my containers and one with the same testing with STL containers

## 🔎 Vector ⤵️

```
Vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size.
```
[Reference](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/)

## 🔎 Stack ⤵️

```
Stacks are a type of container adaptor, specifically designed to operate in a LIFO context (last-in first-out), where elements are inserted and extracted only from one end of the container.
```

## 🔎 Map ⤵️

```
Maps are associative containers that store elements formed by a combination of a key value and a mapped value, following a specific order.
```

You should look at [this link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-set-1-search-and-insertion/) and [this other link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-set-2-delete/) to better understand what a BST (Binary Search Tree) is.

## 💡 Usage

- Clone my project and its [tester](https://github.com/JehanneDussert/ft_containers_test)

```
git clone https://github.com/JehanneDussert/ft_containers.git && cd ft_containers ;
git clone https://github.com/JehanneDussert/ft_containers_test.git && cd ft_containers_test && sh test.sh
```
