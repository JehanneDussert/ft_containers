### Welcome to my ft_containers repository 👋

⭐️ The objective of ft_containers is to implement the various container types of the C++ standard template library (coded in C++98).

## ✅ Completed ⤵️
- Vector container & tester
- Stack container & tester
- enable_if, equal/lexicographical compare, reverse_iterator, iterators_traits
- std::pair, std::make_pair

## 📈 To be completed ⤵️
- Container : Map & tester
- one binary with my containers and one with the same testing with STL containers

## 🔎 Vector ⤵️

```
The std::vector is a sequence container that encapsulates dynamic size arrays.
```

## 🔎 Map ⤵️

```
The std::map is a sorted associative container that contains key-value pairs with unique keys.
```

## 🔎 Stack ⤵️

```
The std::stack class is a container adapter that gives the programmer the functionality of a stack - specifically, a LIFO (last-in, first-out) data structure.
```

## 💡 Usage

- Clone my project and its [tester](https://github.com/JehanneDussert/ft_containers_test)

```
git clone https://github.com/JehanneDussert/ft_containers.git && cd ft_containers ;
git clone https://github.com/JehanneDussert/ft_containers_test.git && cd ft_containers_test && sh test.sh
```
